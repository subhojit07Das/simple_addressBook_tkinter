# simple_addressBook_tkinter

# First
I have imported all the necessary module then creating the main Window where all the stuffs will get displayed, after that I'm giving a title for the window and specifying the size.

# Second
I have attached the env file where all the database information is stored which is needed for the proper connection with the mysql database.

# Third
In this step I have created the connection information and inserting all the entries which will be given by the user. And also when the user will click this button the entries will get stored inside the table and the entries will get removed from the screen so that user can type the next address.
(I have already created a database and table in mysql)

# Fourth
In this step I have created a "show record" button so that when a user will click the button a new page will get open and they can see the other people who are there in the address book.

# Five
Here i have a created another which will basically call the submit_db function and this is attached with the "add to address book" button\

# Six
In this i have created all the label widget, button widget. And also placed the widget at the appropriate place.
